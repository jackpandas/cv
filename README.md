###Short Biography: 
I am an academic who specialises in the normative analysis of armed conflict and violence in the context of digital society. I am trained in both qualitative and quantitative research methods, and my research involves analysing the ethical, legal and political issues inherent in international public policy. I am currently working as a research associate and teaching fellow at the Centre for Science & Security Studies, having recently completed work on an ESRC-funded project in partnership with the UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory. The project studied the challenges that novel technologies and technological innovation pose to international law, and I have a continuing research interest in the challenges that novel technologies pose to the conduct of contemporary warfare, such as autonomous weapon systems and data analytics.  

###Teaching Experience and Qualifications:
I have four years of lecturing/seminar teaching at a leading Russell Group university. I have designed and taught modules at BA, MA and executive development levels, as well as experience working as a course tutor for both military, police and civil service courses. I have a strong record in course design and delivery demonstrated in my consistent track record of positive feedback from previous students. I am also dedicated to developing online teaching tools and methods to widen access to academic knowledge and to increase the impact of academic research in policy communities. I hold a Postgraduate Certificate of Academic Practise in Higher Education. I have convened modules on guerrilla warfare (Theory and History), applied philosophy and war, the law, ethics and politics of dirty wars, technology and public policy, government and warfare in fragile states, and general academic skills. 

###Research impact and awards:
* Research Associate, RCUK Global Uncertainties Science and Security Programme Grant: SNT Really Makes Reality: Technological Innovation, Non-Obvious Warfare and the Challenges to International Law (ESRC Ref: ES/K011413/1).
* Two inputs to the 2015 UK Strategic Defence & Security Review process via DSTL and the Development Concepts & Doctrine Centre.
* I authored sections of a leading report on the utilisation of the Defence Estate of the United Kingdom published by the Centre for Defence Studies, King’s College London
* I was the course tutor in charge of delivering an executive education programme to Brunei’s Ministry of Defence, responsible for teaching and pastoral care for 28 students on an MA-level, non-accredited course. I have also been responsible for organising training courses delivering academic research and theoretical training to the Home Office’s Office of Security and Counter Terrorism as well as the Ministry of Defence’s International Intelligence Directors Course, delivering lectures to the latter.

###Skills
Aside from teaching and research, my strengths lie in project design and management. I have managed a bar with a £750k turnover and a staff of 20. In this role I designed and implemented the daily and weekly business management processes. I also have four years experience working in the national press.  I am currently learning full stack javascript web development at Founders & Coders, a London-based coding co-operative and social enterprise. Outside university I have also been an assistant instructor in Brazilian jiu jitsu, teaching people with a wide range of age, skill and ability, including students with special needs.
